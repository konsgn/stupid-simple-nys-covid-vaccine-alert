# Bad NYS Covid Vaccine Availibilty Script

A very bad script to check if there are any vaccine slots available in NYS.

## Running the script.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Update addressTarget to your desired location
3. Run the script.
4. Turn on amphetamine or otherwise to keep your machine running.

When Rick is singing, sprint to book your slot.

## Design notes.

On first run, it'll open a new tab. This is because I'm lazy, but also to make sure things work okay.
